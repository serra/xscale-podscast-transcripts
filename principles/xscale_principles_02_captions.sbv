Hello everyone, welcome to the second XSCALE webinar on the principles of agile organization.

0:00:10.330,0:00:12.330
My name is Peter Merel.

0:00:15.730,0:00:21.779
Last session we looked at how agile organization targets exponential return on investment through new products and services.

0:00:22.720,0:00:28.380
Today, we'll look at how to create those things by the second XSCALE principle: Simple design.

0:00:28.929,0:00:31.919
There are three popular schools of lean agile design:

0:00:32.439,0:00:33.910
Design Thinking,

0:00:33.910,0:00:36.540
Set based design, and emergent design.

0:00:38.020,0:00:41.819
The weird thing is: these three schools have almost nothing to do with one another.

0:00:42.180,0:00:46.860
So, can we refactor the three into a single simple design method?

0:00:47.320,0:00:53.520
Let's start with design thinking. It begins with understanding the problem, having it written down as a concrete brief.

0:00:53.770,0:00:58.409
Observing people who have the problem until we can clearly describe their point of view.

0:00:59.020,0:01:02.909
Ideating, which is a dreadful word for brainstorming

0:01:03.670,0:01:10.049
until we have enough ideas slapped up on the wall that we can winner them down to something that seems to be worth prototyping.

0:01:10.689,0:01:15.389
Testing the prototype to see whether it satisfies the customers point of view.

0:01:16.180,0:01:18.180
Well, something seems to be missing.

0:01:18.250,0:01:24.239
There's nothing here that drives towards simplicity. As a case in point, this is the

0:01:24.790,0:01:26.790
2003 Nokia N-Gage.

0:01:27.280,0:01:29.430
Possibly the worst designed phone of all time.

0:01:29.710,0:01:37.650
But really it's fairly astonishing, that in 2003 a device was able to achieve essentially the same functionality as iPhone 4 years later.

0:01:39.369,0:01:41.969
Nevertheless this thing sank like a stone.

0:01:44.290,0:01:51.209
Nokia brought in Ideo - the design studio that invented design thinking and they came up with this beauty.

0:01:52.390,0:01:55.649
As you can see, it has dramatically improved look and feel.

0:01:56.409,0:01:58.499
Yet, it also sank like a stone.

0:02:00.130,0:02:02.460
They gave it another 4 years before they tried it again.

0:02:03.460,0:02:05.009
Nokia had to answer iPhone.

0:02:05.009,0:02:12.208
So they asked Ideo to help them and came up with N-Gage Next Gen, and an alternative to the App Store.

0:02:12.760,0:02:16.350
That lasted about another year before sinking like a stone.

0:02:18.370,0:02:20.880
Clearly Apple thought different when it came to design.

0:02:21.730,0:02:28.080
Jobs was certain that design was not something that customers could do for you. Famously quoting Henry Ford

0:02:28.120,0:02:33.120
who'd said if he'd asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.

0:02:34.510,0:02:37.380
Another part of it was that drive towards simplicity.

0:02:38.200,0:02:40.200
This is a Picasso that

0:02:40.959,0:02:45.149
Apple University used to teach design, and you can see it is literally

0:02:46.150,0:02:47.890
de-signing,

0:02:47.890,0:02:50.610
systematically removing non-essential design elements.

0:02:51.790,0:02:59.459
The top left hand corner is probably the most photorealistic thing that Picasso ever drew and by the time we get to the last image ...

0:02:59.620,0:03:02.670
Well, you can't remove a single line.

0:03:03.250,0:03:05.250
Even the heavy one underneath.

0:03:05.769,0:03:08.249
If you take that away it looks like

0:03:08.890,0:03:10.890
bedsheets on a clothes line.

0:03:11.109,0:03:17.579
People naturally focus on the look and feel of the device. The stuff that we can see and touch.

0:03:17.980,0:03:19.980
But this is an illusion.

0:03:20.610,0:03:24.050
The devices that we see exist within a

0:03:24.600,0:03:31.189
continuum, a design space of all of the possibilities, all of the solution alternatives.

0:03:33.060,0:03:35.090
This space is not flat.

0:03:35.130,0:03:42.439
It's curved like space-time. The curves in design space are naturally induced by the impact of products on the market.

0:03:42.480,0:03:44.869
We've gone into this in our first webinar.

0:03:45.870,0:03:50.389
When industrial designers focus on the swoops and curves and

0:03:50.610,0:03:54.050
bevels and bezels of devices they miss the wood for the trees.

0:03:54.720,0:04:00.230
This is what Steve Jobs understood in his bones. The iPhone isn't something you can hold in your hand.

0:04:01.170,0:04:07.849
If you're designing experiences and devices rather than ecosystems of services you're not actually designing products.

0:04:09.210,0:04:15.950
This doesn't mean design thinking and user centered design aren't valuable - just that their inside out not

0:04:16.410,0:04:18.410
outside in. We need both.

0:04:19.080,0:04:23.539
There are five value streams that make up a service ecosystem.

0:04:23.610,0:04:30.289
And they've been described by venture capitalist Dave McClure in terms of an acronym AARRR,

0:04:30.840,0:04:33.590
which sums up what he calls the pirate metrics.

0:04:34.440,0:04:41.029
If a product design doesn't measure up in these metrics, then Dave won't invest in it and neither should you.

0:04:42.540,0:04:49.219
The first of these is Acquisition. You have to be able to bring customers into your ecosystem.

0:04:50.970,0:04:57.049
Activation is a value stream that causes the customer to identify themselves, preferably including their credit card details.

0:04:58.650,0:05:02.120
Retention is a value stream that keeps the customer in the ecosystem.

0:05:03.270,0:05:08.299
Revenue is how you get paid, but not necessarily by the people who you think of as your customers.

0:05:09.570,0:05:17.149
Referral isn't just Net Promoter Score. It's a value stream whose function is to cause one customer to bring another into the ecosystem.

0:05:19.139,0:05:21.589
Every one of these value streams has a dark side.

0:05:24.810,0:05:30.290
When we talk about unhappy paths in testing we generally mean defects and deviations from the spec.

0:05:30.290,0:05:34.279
But the real unhappy paths help leaking customers to other ecosystems.

0:05:34.920,0:05:40.550
Let's look outside in to see how ecosystem design applied to the original iPhone.

0:05:41.250,0:05:48.529
Apple completely redesigned its acquisition value stream. It took its products out of the big-box stores where it had seen

0:05:48.960,0:05:56.749
Kodak get killed by Fuji Film, and where it was struggling itself as USA sales would promote its competition on

0:05:57.570,0:06:00.619
functionality and price rather than design quality and experience.

0:06:01.530,0:06:09.440
May seem we've wandered away from design into marketing, but consider the huge number of systems required to make Apple's retail stores work.

0:06:10.530,0:06:17.150
Effort in engineering those stores was Titanic and provisioning them was a critical part of iPhone as a product.

0:06:17.640,0:06:20.929
The obvious killer-feature of iPhone - the multi-touch

0:06:21.360,0:06:29.059
screen - was an astonishing retention play. The moment you started to play with iPhone, you could never go back to a bank of chiclet keys.

0:06:30.180,0:06:36.410
The seamless activation value stream for iPhone was a key part of its commercial success - 

0:06:36.900,0:06:42.949
multiplying a global base of low revenue media sales by the price of the world's most expensive phone.

0:06:43.020,0:06:45.409
There's also a feat of engineering to combine

0:06:46.020,0:06:48.020
rapid powered charging and

0:06:48.210,0:06:51.949
high-speed communications into one tiny little cable.

0:06:52.860,0:06:56.960
Apple's new revenue stream took an entire industry by surprise and

0:06:57.120,0:07:00.440
replaced a lot of them with a little app that everyone has in their pocket.

0:07:00.660,0:07:04.580
If you think that's marketing and not engineering you don't know what engineering is.

0:07:05.310,0:07:09.080
Finally, the referral value stream leveraged find my friends at

0:07:09.420,0:07:13.699
iMessage to induce parents worrying about their children's locations and

0:07:14.340,0:07:22.010
SMS bills to lash out on Christmas iPods and iPhones for the kids. Not everyone understands design this way:

0:07:23.000,0:07:29.260
"Five-hundred dollars, fully subsidized with a plan? I said that is the most expensive phone in the world

0:07:29.260,0:07:33.279
and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard."

0:07:33.860,0:07:39.669
Obviously design space is very highly dimensional; this two-dimensional representation doesn't really do it justice.

0:07:40.760,0:07:46.480
The only way the distinctions we're drawing can have a real predictive power is basing them on real

0:07:46.610,0:07:50.560
analytics of real customer behavior and reducing them to clearly expressed

0:07:51.169,0:07:54.429
practical and ideally automated tests.

0:07:55.400,0:07:59.530
There's no end of analytic services in the world to do the former. For the latter,

0:07:59.530,0:08:03.910
we reach into our agile bag of tricks and pull out behavior driven development.

0:08:05.419,0:08:07.478
BDD's ability to describe

0:08:08.240,0:08:09.889
preconditions, events and

0:08:09.889,0:08:16.329
outcomes across multiple dimensions of system- and customer behavior and to composite these in complex arrangements,

0:08:16.550,0:08:19.930
is a key advantage over prescriptive product specs.

0:08:21.050,0:08:27.430
Where those described points, BDD tests describes entire regions of design space,

0:08:28.370,0:08:31.149
enabling us to reason about them reductively.

0:08:32.150,0:08:37.239
As Sherlock Holmes fans know: when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable,

0:08:38.000,0:08:39.800
must be the design.

0:08:39.800,0:08:43.570
This is critical, because complexity of design space means we can't expect

0:08:44.030,0:08:47.559
to start in one spot and wander around in a linear way.

0:08:47.810,0:08:55.270
We've got to explore it in parallel, recording our learnings as tests to constrain the research and design going forward.

0:08:55.820,0:09:03.309
Applying these across the board to all remaining solution alternatives to knock out the ones that won't satisfy them and refactoring what remains.

0:09:05.860,0:09:10.200
We do this in a repeating time box, using the normal agile ceremonies.

0:09:10.900,0:09:17.069
Prioritize, review the results and reflect on the way that we are conducting the work to optimize its throughput.

0:09:17.680,0:09:20.909
This enables us to rapidly eliminate vast

0:09:20.920,0:09:27.210
swathes of design space, zeroing in on the region with the greatest potential return on investment.

0:09:28.210,0:09:30.539
So now we can return to the original question:

0:09:31.210,0:09:38.669
Can we refactor these design methods, to form a single simple process that reliably targets Jobs'

0:09:39.130,0:09:41.130
elegance of minimal?

0:09:42.670,0:09:43.589
For a start,

0:09:43.589,0:09:49.829
it's not sufficient to understand the brief. The brief might be wrong. We need to measure

0:09:50.230,0:09:54.420
customer behavior to produce the actual numbers that represent the problem.

0:09:55.060,0:10:03.029
Since those numbers change over time, represent what we learn in terms of practical, automated, reproducible tests.

0:10:04.000,0:10:08.849
Then build a range of solutions to those tests, whose benefits

0:10:08.850,0:10:10.980
we can measure generating further data,

0:10:11.350,0:10:13.650
which we can learn in a repeating cycle.

0:10:13.930,0:10:19.859
This cycle of build, measure, and learn should seem pretty familiar to fans of Eric Ries' Lean Startup.

0:10:19.960,0:10:26.759
But there's a critical difference, and that's the BDD tests. In a start-up, we don't have time to wait,

0:10:26.760,0:10:28.380
we've got a very little runway.

0:10:28.380,0:10:35.549
We have to get our one little value stream integrated into a service ecosystem to generate revenue as quickly as possible.

0:10:37.290,0:10:43.369
But if you're not sitting in a garage eating ramen, these tests are critical to assure that you know when new design features

0:10:43.709,0:10:45.709
violate established design constraints.

0:10:46.470,0:10:48.980
We still need continuous, merciless,

0:10:49.559,0:10:55.999
refactoring: the critical design discipline without which there is no simplicity. Not just refactoring the code,

0:10:56.249,0:11:03.108
but also the data, which is to say normalization and clustering, and refactoring the tests so they represent not just examples

0:11:03.109,0:11:05.109
but invariant rules.

0:11:06.689,0:11:13.159
Simple design isn't something that comes from some separate team, in a separate room, in a phase up front ...

0:11:13.259,0:11:17.719
it's a continuous collaborative agile process that engages

0:11:18.239,0:11:21.409
designers with customers and engineers directly.

0:11:22.109,0:11:29.209
Driving innovation, definition and delivery of features, iteration after iteration, at a sustainable pace.

0:11:30.449,0:11:32.959
Design and delivery work hand-in-glove.

0:11:33.959,0:11:41.058
Continuously innovating and refactoring, to attack whatever constraint is currently the bottleneck on our service ecosystem.

0:11:43.169,0:11:45.169
This principle of continuous optimization

0:11:45.540,0:11:49.549
will form the subject of the third of our series of six XSCALE
