Hello, everyone. Welcome to XSCALE's webinar series on the principles of agile organization.

0:00:09.800,0:00:13.000
This is our first session, my name is Peter Merel.

0:00:13.000,0:00:18.460
A lot of my clients these days are interested in taking agile to places

0:00:18.480,0:00:26.100
it hasn't been before and we have a whole bunch of people talking about large-scale agile and business agility. What are these things?

0:00:27.280,0:00:33.580
In  XSCALE, there are six fundamental principles you can't do without if you're going to be an agile organization.

0:00:34.400,0:00:39.960
So we're gonna deal with them one at a time, and that's pretty easy because XSCALE itself is an acronym for these principles.

0:00:41.060,0:00:45.780
The X stands for exponential return on investment.  Now, that's a wonderful

0:00:45.920,0:00:53.220
aspiration and if you are a startup it's essential to attracting investment. No one is going to invest in a risky proposition

0:00:53.400,0:00:57.380
without this kind of idea in the Powerpoint.

0:00:58.460,0:01:02.580
Any startup would be delighted with a single one of these hockey sticks.

0:01:03.000,0:01:08.660
The real question is if you are a going concern, a small to medium, or even large, corporation,

0:01:08.900,0:01:11.440
is exponential growth something that's possible for you?

0:01:13.160,0:01:17.500
On the other hand, in a time of peak

0:01:17.620,0:01:21.560
disruption - if you're trying to do a "slow and steady wins the race" there aren't too many examples

0:01:21.560,0:01:25.080
of businesses that have been able to carry on like that for very long.

0:01:27.020,0:01:31.640
There's an American initiative that comes out of Google and Darpa called Singularity University.

0:01:34.140,0:01:39.080
They have the idea that exponential growth is now the norm that all organizations should be targeting.

0:01:39.220,0:01:42.680
They say you should be expecting to grow a billion-dollar business in about nine months.

0:01:44.120,0:01:49.540
The example they like to use is Kodak, which invented the first digital camera in 1975.

0:01:50.380,0:01:56.180
They patented them, sat on the patents and wouldn't let go of the idea that cameras had to be linked to a chemical film business.

0:01:58.380,0:02:05.460
Eventually the cameras became quite practical. One, two, four megapixels, maybe no more than half a second between pressing the button and hearing the click ...

0:02:07.020,0:02:15.200
Meanwhile Kodak focused their efforts on chemical cameras. In 2012 the point of disruption came and Kodak filed for bankruptcy.

0:02:18.000,0:02:20.940
These devices started getting built into phones.

0:02:20.960,0:02:26.440
The competition narrowed to the phone manufacturers that were able to compete.

0:02:28.640,0:02:35.780
These days, most phones have cameras that are perfectly adequate and people will not pay you very much more money - or possibly any more money -

0:02:35.940,0:02:37.680
for a phone that has more megapixels.

0:02:39.440,0:02:47.160
Once money leaves the equation a bunch of people start building services that simply assume that these devices are ubiquitous.

0:02:47.400,0:02:49.540
Snapchat, Instagram -

0:02:49.820,0:02:55.820
these companies made billions on the proposition that everybody has a digital camera in their pocket.

0:02:57.600,0:03:04.700
That's a lovely proposition for exponential growth, but it's not exponential Growth of a business - it's exponential Growth of a market.

0:03:05.200,0:03:06.200
What's the difference?

0:03:06.800,0:03:09.640
There's a bloke named Kano who came up with this.

0:03:10.320,0:03:13.280
Kano's idea was if we were to graph

0:03:13.840,0:03:18.200
the customer satisfaction versus the investment required to achieve that satisfaction,

0:03:18.280,0:03:21.400
we see different behaviors for different kinds of products.

0:03:22.880,0:03:29.040
There is some like a milk carton. If your milk carton doesn't keep the milk in, it's not satisfying basic expectations.

0:03:29.320,0:03:31.120
You will not sell many of them.

0:03:31.840,0:03:37.200
If you clad it in lead and keep the gamma rays out you're not going to sell any more of them.

0:03:39.280,0:03:46.880
On the other hand if we think about the early days of 
digital cameras, just small, incremental improvements in

0:03:47.160,0:03:52.680
the shutter speed, or the number of megapixels, or the color quality were enormously delightful

0:03:52.680,0:03:55.760
and would sell you huge numbers of devices.

0:03:56.360,0:04:04.640
Well, Kano's insight was at over time, all delighters become basic expectations - and that makes a bit of a mockery of the Singularity

0:04:04.680,0:04:06.160
University exponential curve.

0:04:06.440,0:04:12.400
If we plot its states, obviously you've still got all the disruption working exponentially. That's great,

0:04:12.400,0:04:18.720
but once things dematerialize you're only getting linear growth in the return on investment.

0:04:19.840,0:04:25.760
Once the money goes out of the equation you have to provide an adequate quality digital camera in your mobile phone,

0:04:25.840,0:04:27.400
or you won't sell your mobile phone.

0:04:28.760,0:04:34.760
Then there is a new growth curve, and if you aren't already on it, then you are already behind the eight ball.

0:04:35.640,0:04:39.360
So that means these curves look more like sigmoids.

0:04:40.360,0:04:42.400
S curves.

0:04:42.840,0:04:47.640
You're always going to hit some sort of constraint whether it's in the market, or in the technology, or in the

0:04:47.800,0:04:56.360
behavior of your own company. So the question is always: how do we bake the next curve into our activities?

0:04:56.440,0:05:02.200
But even if you plan it in, if you were to string your sigmoid curves together one after another - like this - well

0:05:02.200,0:05:04.360
you're only going to achieve linear growth.

0:05:05.720,0:05:11.360
Apple had a different idea: stack the curves one on top of another. You're going to get exponential growth in a mature

0:05:11.360,0:05:16.080
organization. This strategy - which we're calling extropy - is the only way we're going to do it.

0:05:17.960,0:05:21.040
Apple have not stopped growing

0:05:21.160,0:05:27.160
just because Steve Jobs passed away. But they have changed their behavior. It's true

0:05:27.240,0:05:34.120
they've doubled and redoubled in size since Jobs died. The market cap is really worth more than the country of Russia.

0:05:35.280,0:05:38.800
But this is the only new product that Apple have released under Cook.

0:05:39.000,0:05:45.440
So it begs a question: if Jobs was still alive and wanted to keep on stacking sigmoids,

0:05:45.440,0:05:47.440
How would he go about it?

0:05:48.040,0:05:50.640
I think we've got a concrete answer to what jobs would have done.

0:05:51.640,0:05:57.720
This is something that builds on existing Microsoft technology. It's an augmented reality visor, it's got a Kinect built into it.

0:05:58.320,0:06:01.520
"Let's take our experience off the wall and then put it on the table over here ... "

0:06:03.040,0:06:04.920
"Create World"

0:06:23.280,0:06:25.240
That is the sound of a delighter.

0:06:26.800,0:06:33.640
"As Zack runs around and plays Zack can easily navigate and manipulate in the world using his voice and his hands."

0:06:34.440,0:06:39.440
"He can walk around the hologram, pan around for different viewpoints and even look inside ... "

0:06:43.760,0:06:50.480
Microsoft bought Minecraft to generate an augmented reality experience that no one else can match. Jobs would have called it

0:06:50.640,0:06:52.920
iReality, but that wasn't to be.

0:06:53.600,0:07:01.200
This is a Google trends picture of apple today. It looks pretty disheartening until you realize the scale - that's not like apples about to go broke.

0:07:01.800,0:07:09.080
iPhone sales continue linearly and even though revenues have dropped, iPhones have at least one more generation before augmented reality

0:07:09.080,0:07:11.160
obsoletes them forever.

0:07:12.360,0:07:18.840
Extropy doesn't mean you magically morph into Steve jobs, but if we don't have the intent we can't realize it.

0:07:19.360,0:07:24.560
Extropy isn't just about products. It is something an agile organization has to apply every day.

0:07:24.760,0:07:31.320
At an epic level, at a per feature level - that's very different to what we usually do in product management.

0:07:31.920,0:07:33.840
This idea of leapfrogging,

0:07:33.840,0:07:41.520
stacking the sigmoids, requires agility and more agility than just agile delivery teams. It requires

0:07:41.520,0:07:43.200
Simple design

0:07:43.400,0:07:45.320
Continuous optimization

0:07:45.640,0:07:47.600
Autonomous teams

0:07:47.600,0:07:49.680
triple loop Learning and

0:07:49.800,0:07:51.280
Ecosystems thinking.

0:07:52.080,0:07:56.600
In the next part of our a webinar series on the principles of agile organization,

0:07:57.000,0:07:59.400
we're going to look very carefully at design.

0:07:59.560,0:08:06.040
Not just design thinking, but designing for simplicity. What Frank Lloyd Wright called "form and function as one".

0:08:06.840,0:08:17.800
